# Mobilenetv2_ssd
A caffe implementation of mobilenetv2_ssd convolution network.  

1.The mAP for mobilenetv2_ssd on my own dataset is less than the mAP for mobilenetv1_ssd, I don't kown why? Â 
  
  2.My mAP result for mobilenetv1_ssd  is a reference  to https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD.  

3.If you want to speed up the mobilenet network,you can reference to https://github.com/yonghenglh6/DepthwiseConvolution and change the Group Gonvolution Layer to Depthwise Convolutional Layer.
